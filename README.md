> Ideas for sample projects that can be build, using dat-protocol for p2p data storage and distribution, mostly collaborative stuff, where dat really shines

Most of the ideas are not well though out, so it's basically pitches to fool around with

## Ideas

### Book shelf
Goodreads, but decentralized

### Fitness app
Fitness app to store your data and also check out how your friends are doing

### Chatroom

### Client-side photo editor (VSCO/Darkroom app)

### Shared audio playlist

### Conference app

This web app should give a functionality both for the conference organizer and the participates.
Main features: information on tracks/talks (speaker bio, links to slides), schedule with push notification on the talks that the user choose.

### Contacts manager

### Dashboard

This app should resemble an HR type dashboard where a user can login and view information about the company. It can have an Employee section that shows the information of that employee like Name, Address, Phone, Email, position in company, how long they have been employed, start date, vacation time remaining etc. The app should also have some sort of project tracking. You could include in some graphs and charts that show company progress year over year. One more thing would be to add a place for the HR person to make a company wide announcement that would show up on the company intranet.

The idea is, that using dat protocol - you can make big savings on cloud storage with this one. Well maybe not big...but savings.

### Employee manager

### File sharing app

One of the most obvious ones

### Gallery or Portfolio app

### Wishlist app

### Hangman

P2P one ofcourse

### Kanban board

### Collaborative Whiteboard

### Movie Reviews

### Movies / IMDB search

### News reader (e.g RSS reader)

### Note taking app

### Planning Poker Cards and planning pocker voter

### Podcast player

### Pocket app
Reas it later kinda app. Requires multiwriter or single superdelegated node.

### Recipes app

### Tic-tac-toe

### ToDo List (Classic)

### Travel app

### Typing test

### DatWakaTime

Analog of wakatime - but simply adding log to your local folder instead of waka server, unfortunately without multiwriter would be unusable for several machines, or on the contrary you can count the time you spend on several projects on different machines or aggregate them.
